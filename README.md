## Starcraft II A3C learning agent

# First off, credits go to Steven Brown, https://github.com/skjb for the PySC2 tutorial and code, and Jaromir, https://github.com/jaara for the A3C tutorial and code for the implementation of the A3C agent.  

As is, PySC2 branch version 7a04e74 is installed via anaconda on Ubuntu 16.04.  Starcraft II client is 3.16.1 on Ubuntu.  Branch has been modified to support the learning Agent.  This is a work in progress and the AI can be started by way of calling python deepmind_api_modified/pysc2/bin/agent.py This hasn't been tested on other systems and may not work.  Updates will come relatively frequently as this is updated.
